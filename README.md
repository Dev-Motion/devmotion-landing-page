## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside repository, you'll see the following folders and files:

â””â”€â”€â”€src
    â”œâ”€â”€â”€assets

```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

The `src/components/` directory for our components. Astro uses the [Snowpack](https://www.snowpack.dev/) module bundler, which means that each component is its own module. This allows us to use the same component in multiple pages without worrying about collisions.

The `src/layouts/` directory contains the layout components for our site. Layouts are special components that wrap other components, and are used to create a consistent layout across multiple pages.

The `src/assets/` directory is where we keep our static assets like images.

The `src/utils/` directory is where we keep our utility functions. These are functions that are used across multiple components, like a function that lets you create class names conditionally while merging of tailwind classes when needed.

The `src/icons/` directory is where we keep our SVG icons. These icons are used across multiple components and are automatically optimized by the `astro-icon` library.

Any static assets that doesn't need optimization, like favicon, can be placed in the `public/` directory.
